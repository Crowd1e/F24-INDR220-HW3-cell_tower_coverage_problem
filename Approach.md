Features and Approach

1. MILP Formulation

The problem is modeled using the following decision variables:
	•	 x_{ij} : Binary variable, 1 if a tower is placed in region (i, j), 0 otherwise.
	•	 y_{ij} : Binary variable, 1 if region (i, j) is covered by at least one tower, 0 otherwise.

Constraints are defined to:
	•	Ensure all covered regions are appropriately linked to tower placements.
	•	Limit the number of towers to the available budget.

2. Implementation Details

	•	Input Data:
	•	populations.txt: A text file containing the population data for each region in the city grid.
	•	Key Function:
	•	cell_tower_coverage_problem(populations_file, T): A Python function that processes the population data and maximum tower count, formulates the optimization problem, and solves it using 		CPLEX.
	•	Optimization Engine:
	•	Utilizes CPLEX to solve the mixed-integer linear programming problem efficiently.
	•	Interactive Notebook:
	•	Developed in a Python notebook for easier step-by-step debugging and visualization.

4. Steps to Solve

	1.	Parse the population data and define the city grid dimensions ( H \times W ).
	2.	Formulate the MILP problem with the objective of maximizing coverage while respecting constraints.
	3.	Use CPLEX to compute the optimal tower placements.
	4.	Output the results, including:
	•	Tower locations ( x_{ij} ).
	•	Total population covered ( y_{ij} ).
	•	Detailed analysis of coverage efficiency and resource allocation.

4. A Matrix Implementation

The matrix  A  is split into three subcategories for the problem formulation:
	1. Main  A  Matrix:
		•	The  x  and  y  variables are split due to the column indexing formula:  i \times W + j .
		•	Using the neighbor-offsets formula for di, dj in [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], all neighboring regions are identified.
		•	Example: For  W = 6, H = 4 , to find the column index of  x_{23} :
		•	Use  i = 1, W = 6, j = 2 .
		•	Column index =  1 * 6 + 2 = 8 .
		•	The  A -matrix columns proceed as follows:  x_{11}  (0th col),  x_{12}  (1st col),  x_{13}  (2nd col), …,  x_{23}  (8th col).
		•	Every neighbor’s row, column, and data index are appended accordingly.
	2. Right-Side of the  A -Matrix:
		•	Corresponds to the -y_{ij} part of the constraint matrix.
		•	Includes a diagonal entry of -1 for each  y_{ij}  until the last entry.
	3. Last Row of the  A -Matrix:
		•	Represents the budget constraint.
		•	Sums all  x_{ij}  variables to ensure =< T , the maximum number of towers allowed.
